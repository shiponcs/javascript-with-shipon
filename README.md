# javascript-with-shipon
I love to write about anything I learn. Javascript is one of the fascinating thing and the thing I love very much. When I explore the world of this language I always try make some notes containing the all cases and crucial points of the concepts so that it may become a handy note. These are the some notes I published so that other may benefit:

- [javascript-1](javascript-1.md): discusses hoisting, closures and technique of debugging a code
- [javascript-2](javascript-2.md): discusses about `this` keyword and where `this` points to based on the different *contexts*.
- [proptotype-chain](prototype-chain.md): discusses one of the most important topic in javascript- Prototype chain, and what happens when we call function with `new` keyword.
- [javascript-function](function-in-javascript.md): I'm really proud of this note, so powerful. I wrote here about the most important thing of modern javascript. What a function is in javascript, what is prototype chain, the power of `new` keyword and how syntactic sugar of ES6 `class` works under the hood.
